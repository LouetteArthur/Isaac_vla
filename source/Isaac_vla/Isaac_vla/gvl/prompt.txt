You are an expert roboticist tasked to predict task completion
percentages for frames of a robot for the task of {task_description}.
The task completion percentages are between 0 and 100, where 100
corresponds to full task completion. We provide several examples of
the robot performing the task at various stages and their
corresponding task completion percentages. Note that these frames are
in random order, so please pay attention to the individual frames
when reasoning about task completion percentage.
Initial robot scene: [{initial_image}]
In the initial robot scene, the task completion percentage is 0.
Now, for the task of {task_description}, output the task completion
percentage for the following frames that are presented in random
order. For each frame, format your response as follow: Frame i:
Frame Description: DESCRIPTION, Task Completion Percentages: PERCENTAGE%
